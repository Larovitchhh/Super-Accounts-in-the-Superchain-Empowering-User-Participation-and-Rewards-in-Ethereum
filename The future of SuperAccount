The Superchain Eco team is already iterating rapidly. Short-term plans include adding more badges and app integrations to expand the ecosystem's utility. Looking ahead, version 2.0 will leverage upcoming Superchain InterOp features, using multi-chain Safes for a truly seamless experienceâ€”imagine one account managing assets and actions across dozens of OP Chains effortlessly.As the Superchain matures, Super Accounts could evolve into a standard for L2 ecosystems, inspiring similar systems in networks like Arbitrum's Orbit chains. With Ethereum's roadmap emphasizing modularity, tools like these will be pivotal in realizing a frictionless multichain future.
